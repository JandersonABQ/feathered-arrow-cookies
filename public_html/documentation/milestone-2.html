<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
This company brochure will be one page and will consist of the following sections:

<h3>Navbar:</h3> I want the website to have a navbar at the top with the company logo(feathered arrow cookies). I want the navbar to contain links for navigation to future pages that I will make after bootcamp. the navbar links will be home, about us, gallery, services(other desserts), and contact us.

<h3>Jumbotron:</h3> I want to display a jumbotron with as a welcome section. I want this section to have some text and an order now button. I want the text to say "custom cookies for all occasions." this section will also have so cookie creations.
<h3>Container:</h3>In this section I want to have an area of text to separate the jumbotron and the other picture gallery. this section will have say "let us help you celebrate life's moments".
<h3>Picture collection:</h3>This section will have a picture gallery to show what cookies she has made and for what occasions. (birthdays, weddings, baby showers, holidays, and retirements). I want to make the cookie pictures enlarge when the customer hovers over them.
<h3>Container:</h3>This section will have some text and a button for the cookie collections link that will be added after bootcamp. the text in this section will say "Need some inspiration for your event?..check out our cookie collections". I have added this section to split the gallery and the about me section, so the webpage is not flooded with photos and has areas to break up photo sections.
<h3>About Me:</h3> I want to include an about me section with a picture of the owner. I also want to include a quick bio of how she got started, types of cookie designs, and info about her business.
<h3>Reviews:</h3> I want to add a section of customer reviews. I want to display her business rating with a stars(point system). and display some customer comments. I want to also have an area to leave a review.
<h3>Contact Info Section:</h3>I want to have a section for customers to contact the owner. this section will have email link, FAQ link, and section for following on social media sites. I want this section to have a heading that says "Connect with us" and have logos for facebook, instagram, and TikTok.
<h3>Footer:</h3> And last I want a footer with the same links in the top navbar so customers can navigate without having to scroll back to the top.
