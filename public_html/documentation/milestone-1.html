<h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>

<h2>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3> For this project I will be using front-end web development to create a website for a <br>
                     company brochure. <br>
    <h3>Audience</h3> This site will be designed with the consumer in mind, and is meant to showcase the <br>
                      company's customizable products. The target audience will be consumers who are purchasing cookies<br>
                      to celebrating all types of occasions. <br>
    <h3>Goal</h3> My goal for this website is to build a site that advertises company products and establishes <br>
                  a way to interact with customers. I want the site to highlight the custom and creative aspect of the
<br>
                  business by showcasing the different cookies. I want to use subtle colors and layouts so the cookies
<br>
                  will draw the focus of the audience. My other goal is to continue to expound on my skills in web <br>
                  development and further my knowledge in the front-end fundamentals.

<h2>Persona</h2>
    <h3>Name:</h3> Amber
    <h3>Age:</h3> 29
    <h3>Profession:</h3> Amber is a Human Resource representative for a private health care company.
    <h3> Technology:</h3>Amber is a power user of technology. she uses computers and office equipment every day for her <br>
                        Job. She uses Microsoft applications like office, word, and excel. Amber also uses Zoom and other <br>
                         office applications to interact with her associates. In Amber's personal life she uses Apple <br>
                         products like Macbook, iphone, and Apple Watch. Amber loves having all the new technology and <br>
                         because she believes it makes her life easier.
    <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3> As a Human Resource rep Amber has to plan events and work celebrations. Not all<br>
                         celebrations are the same, so she needs ways to make them more specific to the festivity. <br>
                         Amber is looking for a bakery that can make deserts that fit themes of work ceremonies like <br>
                         employee birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, and retirements.
    <h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>  Amber likes to plan events in advance and needs a company that takes orders early <br>
                          and will have her order ready on the set day. <br> Amber finds the desserts at local grocery stores<br>
                         to always be the same, and she wants different products that can be made for the individual that <br>
                         is being celebrated (favorite sports team, superhero, or other personal interests).<br>
                         Amber has turned to local bakeries to find desserts but many of them <br> don't have websites <br>
                         to view products or place orders. <br> Amber is looking for a local baker who can provide <br>
                         an easy-to-use ordering system that does not require her to order in person, which takes <br>
                         away from her being in the office.<br>
                         Amber is having trouble finding businesses that have both custom products and have an online <br>
                         presence to view products and have the ability to place orders.<br>

    <h3>Goals:</h3> I want to find a bakery website that makes custom orders, has prices and pictures of their <br>
                    work, so I don't have to place orders in person.
    <h3>User Story:</h3>  I want to make it easier to celebrate my coworkers.
