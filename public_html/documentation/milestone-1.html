<h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>

<h2>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3> For this project I will be using front-end web development to create a website for a <br>
                     company brochure. <br>
    <h3>Audience</h3> This site will be designed with the consumer in mind, and is meant to showcase the <br>
                      company's customizable products. The target audience will be consumers who are <br>
                     celebrating all occasions. <br>
    <h3>Goal</h3> My goal for this website is to build a site that advertises company products and establishes <br>
                  a way to interact with customers. I want the site to highlight the custom and creative aspect of the
<br>
                  business by showcasing the different cookies. I want to use subtle colors and layouts so the cookies
<br>
                  will draw the focus of the audience. My other goal is to continue to expound on my skills in web <br>
                  development and further my knowledge in the front-end fundamentals.
