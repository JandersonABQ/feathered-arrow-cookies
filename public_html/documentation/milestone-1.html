                         her business without spending excessive time on social media platforms.
    <h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>  Raquel currently uses social media to promote her business and finds it hard to
                         manage multiple platforms for communicating with her customers.
                         Raquel wants to separate her business operations from the social media apps and direct
                         customers to her website, so she can easily take orders and schedule them appropriately.
                         one problem Raquel had been having was double booking or sometimes losing orders through her
